# GeforceNowSearcher

## Overview
The searching on the Geforce Now website sucks so I threw this together to see what games I have that are available to stream.

No loading states or anything yet so give it a sec to update the games list once you put a url in.

## Requirements
You need a steam API key to use this. Haven't configured an env file or anything yet so stick it at the top of `steam.controller.ts`.
You need to be using a vanity URL on steam. Set it from edit profile.

## Runniong it
1. Run `npm run start` in the *backend* folder
2. Run `npm run start` in the *geforce-now-searcher* folder
